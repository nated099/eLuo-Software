Recommended Use:

    Within the software is an option to create a restore point. It automatically selects when you select the "tune-up" task. As a precaution please run this before anything else
    Currently, the tune-up task (in it's early stages) and the Hirundo Removal page are the only modules of the software that can be used by the public. Use these at your leisure, and understand that they do make various changes that are meant to assist with issues relative to performance. If a setting seems to have changed (i.e. hibernate) and you preferred it the way it was, you can use the restore point I mentioned before. 
    After using the software, please provide any feedback you feel necessary. This application automatically creates a log file in the C:\ directory. You can feel free to send me this file if you run into any issues as well as a description of what happened. 



More to be added to this site, and the application soon!
